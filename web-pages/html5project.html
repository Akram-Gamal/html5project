				<summary>My Childhood</summary>
				<p>I was born and grew up in Cairo, Egypt. I had a semi hard childhood, as I had to work from a very youg age, around 9 to be specific. I kept working ever since in my vacations between school. When I gradyated high school, I found a good job in a housing company and I stayed there for three years along with college which was overwhelming and exhausting. I developed back and neck pain from too much sitting that I eventually had to quit. Right now, I'm a top-rated virtual assistant on Upwork and I strive to make a decent income to afford my expenses and to not depend on my parents, they have enough expenses already. I'm here hoping that I develop a new skill (web design) to open many more doors for me and enable me to increase my value as a freelancer.</p>
