			<p>First things first, I study English Language and Literature at the Faculty of Arts, Cairo University. Before I even apply to college and right after high school, I applied for a job as data entry specialist and web researcher in a housing company. I got accepted after a tough training period and I started as a part-timer. Skip a couple of months, it was time for me to begin attending lectures at college and it was too overwhelming being a working student, but I always tried to do my best. <a href="about.hrml">Read The Full Story Here</a></p>

			<h1>My Journey on Upwork</h1>
			<p>On the 17th of June, 2018, I satrted a profile on Upwork and started offergin my sevices as a virtual assistant and data entry specialist. I mainly did that because I started having neck and back issues after being at the housig company for over two years and I wanted to have a work from home type of job to have more time and maybe start working out.</p>
